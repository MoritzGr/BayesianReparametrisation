# BayesianReparametrisation
This is the Github repository for the paper "Bayesian Reparametrisation of Neural Networks". It contains the code created for the reproduction of the reparametrised neural network, the slides for a presentation of the paper and the paper itself.

NonKeras.py - the first attempt at reproduction without Keras. It was not successful.

KerasLambda.py - the attempt at reproduction with Keras Lambda Layers. It is the basis for the results of the paper.
